I like collaborating with people, I enjoy facilitating groups. Even though I'm generally a fairly private person, I greatly value openness, transparency and inclusion when working in the open source arena.

I've also learnt the value in knowing, and accepting, your strengths weaknesses and embracing others for the strengths they bring to a project.

Open source started as a lose collection of individuals throwing patches around and evolved through collaborative on-line tools such as SourceForge and Google Code in connection with CSV, SVN and other source management utilities. The current peak of that evolution can be found in the combination of Git as a utility and GitHub as a collaboration medium. While I'm concerned about our collective worship of GitHub, it really does represent an amazing step forward and is giving us a massive boost in open source activity and productivity.

But obviously we're not at the end of the journey and we may never be able to identify the "end" of open source as a movement, philosophy and method of producing software.

So what's next? Where is this heading and where could we be pushing for improvement?

## Openness

Consider the revolution of Wikipedia. It may be mundane now but if you were around before it existed, if you grew up in a world where the central authority of the encyclopaedia which we had to fully submit to, you'll know what a real revolution in human collaboration and the collection of human knowledge it is. Wikipedia is amazing because it's concrete implementation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in its ability to collect a long-tail of trivia about the world (and universe!). But the most amazing part of Wikipedia, the real revolutionary part of it, is the attitude toward openness and the way it brings together disparate individuals to collaborate on the collection and curation of human knowledge. The quality and depth of the majority of articles produced on Wikipedia easily surpasses anything produced by the encyclopaedia editors of old. Even the amazing Douglas Adams didn't imagine that his proto-Wikipedia could be built by being completely open, his had to have official editors.
